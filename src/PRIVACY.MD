## Information Collection and Use

### Personal Information

The Service does **not require** users to provide personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or postal addresses in order to function.

If personal information is voluntarily provided (for example, through a support request or issue report), it will only be used for the specific purpose for which it was provided and will not be retained longer than necessary.

To improve reliability, stability, and performance, the Service may collect **limited, non-personal, and aggregated information**, including:

## Service Providers

We may use trusted third-party services to help operate and improve the Service, including services that provide anonymized telemetry for application reliability and stability.

These third parties are only given access to information necessary to perform their specific tasks and are required to protect it and not use it for any other purpose.

## Data Security

We take reasonable and commercially acceptable measures to protect the information we collect. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

Information is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

The Service is intended for use by children, including those under the age of 13.

We do **not** knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children. The Service does not require users to provide personal information in order to use its features.

If personal information is voluntarily provided (for example, through a support request), it will only be used for the specific purpose for which it was provided and will not be shared with third parties, except as necessary to operate the Service or comply with applicable laws.

If a parent or guardian believes that their child has provided personal information to us, they may contact us, and we will promptly review and delete such information where appropriate.

We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children’s use of online services and to contact us with any privacy-related questions or concerns.
